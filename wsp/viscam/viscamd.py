A daemon for communicating with the SUMMER accesories. Keeping the viscam
name to keep consistent with the nomenclature within wsp.

This daemon connects and communicates with the flask web server on the SUMMER
raspberry pi to control the summer filter wheel, summer shutter, and other
(future) hardware.
