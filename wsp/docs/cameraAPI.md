# Generic WSP Camera API

## Intro
This is a document to specify a generic camera API that WSP will use to communicate with any number of cameras that will get installed on the WINTER observatory. This will be a key need to enable camera switching, and to avoid having to constantly update WSP as cameras are added and we transition from SUMMER to WINTER.
