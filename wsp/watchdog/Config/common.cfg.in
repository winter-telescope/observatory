# Common configuration parameters for the Robo-AO system
#
# This file sets common parameters that are used throughout the Robo-AO software.
# Candidates for inclusion in this file are directories used in several places,
# variables that must be used by various routines and other similar items.  
# Anything that needs to be the same within all of the Robo-AO processes should
# also be in here.

# Note: This file, common.cfg.in, is used by the CMake system to generate 
# common.cfg.  If you are editing common.cfg, you're going to lose the changes
# whenever CMake is run again.  Making a change for a quick test should not be
# an issue, but any permanent changes MUST be updated in the .in file or they
# will be lost.
#
# The variable @PROJECT_BASE_DIR@ is set in the top level CMakeLists.txt.  Change
# the setting in that file to change the base directory for the software if
# necessary.

# observing data in the directory for the same night when some data (such as
# calibrations) are taken before the UT crosses 0.
