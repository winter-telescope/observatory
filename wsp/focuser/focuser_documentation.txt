1. The focus loop mainly relies on the method of minimizing fwhm, or 
full width half max of a gaussian. It does so by running the get fwhm
procedure in genstats, and will generate a catalog and .stats file and/or
use pregenerated versions of those files if the method has been run more
than once. All "sextractor could not" failures are the result of operations
in this file but are more likely the result of sextractor itself failing or
it not being fed appropriate information. For this reason, genstats is best
not modified and left alone. 

For the plot generation, there is a plot_curve file that is called upon by
summerfocusloop, another python file which has a plotting method that works
with plot_curve to generate the best fit parabola and display it. 

Summerfocusloop manages the focus loop object, and is responsible for intaking
image files, feeding them to genstats, collecting the median fwhm of objects
in an image, and getting std of the fwhm values, both of which are saved to
the object and outputted to the console.

Any parameters, notably the bounds of a respective filter range, are modified
in the focus loop section of the config file. pixel scale and filepaths can
also be edited here.
