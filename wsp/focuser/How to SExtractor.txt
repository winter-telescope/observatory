-------------------- ~ Installing SExtractor ~ --------------------------
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Install fftw3 (for plotting fourier transforms) using:
	
	sudo apt-get update -y
	sudo apt-get install -y fftw3-dev

Note that if you have a directory in mind, use PREFIX== after the
second command or do the following in your intended directory:

	git clone https://github.com/FFTW/fftw3.git

2.Download OpenBLAS:
	
	git clone https://github.com/xianyi/OpenBLAS.git

make sure you have GNU GCC installed by running:

	sudo apt-get install gfortran

cd into OpenBLAS and run:

	make FC=gfortran

then:

	mkdir installation
	
	make PREFIX=/path/to/installation/ install
	
if that doesn't work, then run:

	sudo apt-get install libopenblas-dev

3. Clone source SExtractor code:

	git clone https://github.com/astromatic/sextractor

and then cd into the sextractor folder you made to run:

	sh autogen.sh

You may get errors to install libtool and autogen, you do that by running:

	sudo apt-get install autoconf
	sudo apt-get install libtool
	
and rerunning autogen.
	
Then run:

	./configure --enable-openblas

This will likely throw an error saying openblas headers have
not been found. In this case, just run it again without the
flag:

	./configure


4.If this still fails and gives the error "ATLAS Header files not found",
you need to run psuedo-ATLAS (some packages from ATLAS that the program
can run). Run these four lines:

	sudo add-apt-repository universe
	sudo add-apt-repository main
	sudo apt-get update 

	sudo apt-get install libatlas-base-dev liblapack-dev libblas-dev

and then run the configure command with no flags again

5.Run:

	make -j

and

	sudo make install
